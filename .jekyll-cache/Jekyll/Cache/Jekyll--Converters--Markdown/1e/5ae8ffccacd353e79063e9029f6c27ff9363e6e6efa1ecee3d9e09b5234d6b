I"<p>After a heavy stint of doing PCB layout recently, I ended up with a badly strained right hand. After that, I came up with the setup below and I haven’t had strain since then.</p>

<p>Step one was to replace my classic-shaped mouse with an <a href="(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIFNTMC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)">Anker ergonomic mouse</a>. I also realized that my strain was mostly due to the clicking action itself, which requires more muscle usage compated to simply dragging the mouse around. So, I split the clicking and dragging between my two hands. I now use my right hand mostly to just drag the cursor around:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my left hand sits on top of an Xbox contreller, which has its buttons programmed to act as mouse buttons:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I use the Xbox controller on my left hand to do the mouse clicks. I also have controller profiles that have keyboard shortcuts assigned to the Xbox controller buttons. This helps me do PCB layout faster.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I used <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367670/Controller_Companion/">Controller Companion</a> to do program the Xbox controller. Controller Companion works really well, and I have not noticed any lag at all in the inputs.</p>
