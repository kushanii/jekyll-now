I"^<p>Starting a blog has been on my mind for a while, but it took some intellectual courage to finally get it going. Up until recently, I felt that unless I could literally write a book on a subject, I simply didnâ€™t know enough about it. In that case, why should I bother writing some dilettante ramblings? What good would that do to the reader?</p>
