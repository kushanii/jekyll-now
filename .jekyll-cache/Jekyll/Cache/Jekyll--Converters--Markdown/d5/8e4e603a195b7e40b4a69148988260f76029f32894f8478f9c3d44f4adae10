I"m	<p>After a heavy stint of doing PCB layout recently, I ended up with a badly strained right hand. So, I came up with a DIY setup which helped me so much to alleviate the strain I was experiencing.</p>

<p>Step one was to replace my classic-shaped mouse with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIFNTMC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Anker ergonomic mouse</a>. I also realized that my strain was mostly due to the clicking action itself, which requires more muscle usage compared to simply dragging the mouse around. So, I split the clicking and dragging between my two hands. I now use my right hand mostly to just drag the cursor around:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Meanwhile, my left hand sits on top of an Xbox controller which has its buttons programmed to act as mouse buttons. Meaning that, pressing X triggers a left mouse click and pressing B triggers a right mouse click.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I use the Xbox controller on my left hand to do the mouse clicks. I also have controller profiles that have keyboard shortcuts assigned to the Xbox controller buttons. This helps me do PCB layout faster.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I used <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367670/Controller_Companion/">Controller Companion</a> to program the Xbox controller. Controller Companion works really well with no input lag. I also programmed some keyboard keys. For example, the start button is “e”, which is the properties window hotkey in KiCad, the PCB layout software that I am using. The right analog stick is assigned as a mouse scroll.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Controller Companion on Steam lets one assign mouse and keyboard bindings to Xbox controller buttons.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This setup feels a bit awkward at first, but I found myself getting used to it really quickly!</p>
